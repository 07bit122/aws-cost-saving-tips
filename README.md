Practical guide to saving costs while utilizing AWS

# About me
I am a seasoned Software Engineer with experience building applications and running infrastructure in public and private clouds for 15+ years. During 2024-2025, my employer Ginkgo Bioworks had some lofty goals to cut down the AWS spend by 50% in a year. Their AWS bill for 2023 was $10M. They wanted to bring that down to under $5M by the end of 2025 (Goals were set mid-2024). Glad to report that by Q3 2025, we were tracking towards $3.5M in AWS spend by the end of 2025 beating the goal by a big margin. Hope you find the information provided here helpful.
